Then go to the Launch List Tab and tap on the Mission you want to visualize. Wait for the 'Ready to visualize' Toast message to appear, then \n    hit the 'Visualize in LG' button. You will be able to see the desired visualization in the Liquid Galaxy Rig.\n3. You can navigate through the LG from the Map tab, learn what the icons and colored polygons stand for from the 'Info Tab', and Clean the \n   visualization with the help of 'LG Tasks' from the menu.",

If you can not connect to the LG rig, first make sure they are both on the same network; either you can connect to \n    the WiFi of a third device or connect LG to the Tablet's hotspot. Check that the credentials are correctly filled in and try again.\n2. To find the IP address of the LG (or the host Laptop in case of VM setup), type 'ifconfig' in the terminal if \n    you're on Mac or Linux and 'ipconfig' for Windows.\n3. For low-end LG rigs, sometimes the visualization doesn't appear the first time. Hit the 'Visualize in LG' button \n    once more to solve this.",

To Twist at an angle, one can use two fingers and give a screw movement in the Map screen.\n4. To Zoom, one can pinch the screen and move the fingers outwards or inwards to zoom in and zoom out, respectively. \n     We can also zoom by pressing the + and - icons provided on the Map screen.\n5. To Tilt, one can use two fingers and give it linear movement in an upward direction."

    "lsfn": "Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40",
    "lsd_01": "SLC-3W was originally built for Atlas-Agena launches and the first flight off the pad was the launch of Samos 1 on October 11, 1960. The facility was extensively damaged 11 months later when Samos 3's booster exploded on the pad, but it was repaired quickly and hosted its next launch slightly under two months afterwards. In 1962-63, the pad was converted for Thor-Agena use and was the primary launching site for Corona reconnaissance satellites for the next decade.",
    "lsd_02": "Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) is a vital SpaceX-operated facility in Florida. It is dedicated to launching Falcon 9 rockets for a variety of missions, including satellite deployments and International Space Station resupply. SLC-40 has undergone upgrades to support booster landings, playing a significant role in SpaceX's reusable rocket technology advancements. This complex serves as a critical hub for cost-effective and efficient access to space",
    "lsd_03": "The South Texas Launch Site is SpaceX's fourth active launch facility, and its first private facility. As of 2019, SpaceX leased three US government-owned launch sites: Vandenberg SLC 4 in California, and Cape Canaveral SLC-40 and Kennedy Space Center LC39A both in Florida. The launch site is in Cameron County, Texas, approximately 17 miles (27 km) east of Brownsville, with launch flyover range over the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "lsd_04": "SpaceX had tentatively planned to upgrade the launch site for use by the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. As of December 2010, the SpaceX launch manifest listed Omelek (Kwajalein) as a potential site for several Falcon 9 launches, the first in 2012, and the Falcon 9 Overview document offered Kwajalein as a launch option. In any event, SpaceX did not make the upgrades necessary to support Falcon 9 launches from the atoll and did not launch Falcon 9 from Omelek. The Site has since been abandoned by SpaceX.",
    "lsd_05": "SpaceX refurbished SLC–4E for Falcon 9 launches in a 24-month process that began in early 2011. The draft environmental impact assessment with a finding of 'no significant impact' was published in February 2011. Demolition began on the pad's fixed and mobile service towers in summer 2011. By late 2012, SpaceX anticipated that the initial launch from the Vandenberg pad would be in 2013, with the larger variant Falcon 9 v1.1.",
    "lsd_06": "In 2015, SpaceX built the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to house both the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy rockets, and their associated hardware and payloads, during preparation for flight. Both types of launch vehicles are transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which rides on rails up the former crawlerway path.",
